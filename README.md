## C++ 2D Collision Simulator
This repository contains a simple object-oriented C++ 2D physics engine with example simulations. The engine models circular particles that interact with each other and the environment, demonstrating basic principles of physics and collision dynamics.

### Features
- Particle Dynamics: Simulates circular particles with varying masses, radii, colors, positions, and velocities (both linear and angular).
- Environment Interactions: Handles collisions between particles and walls, reflecting particles at their angle of incidence.
- Particle Collisions: Updates particle velocities upon collision using physics-based formulas that account for momentum and energy conservation.
  
Example Simulations:
 - Synchrony: Demonstrates synchronized particle behavior.
 - Random: Particles with random initial positions and velocities.
 - MixingGas: Simulates gas particles mixing over time.
